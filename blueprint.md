## Style and Design

- **Framework:** Next.js with TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Typography:** `Inter` font
- **Color Palette:**
  - Kenyan Green: `#008851`
  - Kenyan Red: `#E3000F`
  - Dark background: `#0a0a0a`
  - Light foreground: `#ededed`
- **Layout:** Alternating sections with `bg-white` and `bg-gray-50` for light-themed pages.

## Features

### Implemented Features

- **Home Page:** Hero section, featured programs, upcoming events, and testimonials.
- **About Page:** History, mission, vision, values, leadership message, and facilities showcase.
- **Academics Page:** Lists all academic programs.
- **Admissions Page:** Admission process, general requirements, downloadable resources, and key dates.
- **Contact Page:** Contact form and information.
- **Navbar and Footer:** Consistent navigation and footer across all pages.

### Current Task: Update Admissions Page Background

- **Goal:** Change the background of the "Admission Process" and "Important Dates" sections on the admissions page to a light theme.
- **Plan:**
  1.  Add `bg-white` to the "Admission Process" section to make its background white.
  2.  The "General Requirements" section already has `bg-gray-50`.
  3.  Add `bg-white` to the "Key Dates" section to make its background white.
  4.  This will create a `white`, `gray-50`, `white` alternating pattern, consistent with the rest of the site.
